# crossfilter_d3v4
Hack of the crossfilter example to work with d3js v4 

It is very annoying that the original crossfilter/d3 example works only with d3 v3. Many changes have occured with d3js v4, among them: brushes, scales, format. It is a bit more complex than renaming.

This is a quick and dirty firts attempt to adapt the example. There are still few discrepancies with the original one. But usuable, at least form my point of view.
